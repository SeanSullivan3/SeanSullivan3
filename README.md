# Sean Sullivan's Projects and Repositories! 👨‍🎓

Hello and welcome! 👋  
Thank you for taking a moment to look at my some of my personal projects and learning experiences. Please stay a while... ☕️


## Software Projects
Applications, algorithms, and programs I built to be useful and fun for anyone to try!

### ✈️ [Vacation Planner](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/vacation-planner)
* Looking to go on vacation? This project is a Python and HTML web application that can help you plan an optimal route throughout various user-chosen popular tourist activities for any of 300+ cities world-wide!!

### 🃏 [Euchre App](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/euchre-app)
* Are you ever frustrated because your friends aren't any good at euchre? This project is JavaScript game application that uses React.js to construct an interactive user interface for a user to play with intelligent bots I designed for the game euchre.

### 🤖 [OpenAI Webpage Conclusions](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/openai-webpage-conclusions)
* Curious about how to leverage webscraping to learn about website design? This project is Python program that webscrapes data from a collection of websites and uses Openai's API to help draw important business conclusions about web design and industry relevant information.

## Data Science Projects
Data analysis and visualization projects that I hope help you learn something new today!

### ⚽️ [Copa America 2024 Statisitical Analysis](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/copa-2024-data-analysis)  (In Progress...)
* What determines tournament success at the highest level of soccer? In this project I use Python's advanced data visualization and analysis libraries in Jupyter Notebook to write a statistical report on the determinants of success and failure for the 16 teams in the 2024 Copa America tournament.  

### 📈 [Market Volatility Trends Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/market-volatility-data-analysis)  (In Progress...)
* Can we statistically predict the future daily returns and market volatility of the S&P500 using historical data? In this project I use Python's advanced data analysis and statistics libraries to analyze trends in market returns and volatility with inferential statisitics and probability theory.

## Temporal Projects
Code translation projects and project-based learning repositories all about the [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) framework.  
This past summer I have dove into the world of learning how software engineers build real-world distributed systems. For reference, Temporal is an open source durable execution framework that helps developers manage failures during the execution of complex workflows. Here are some of the projects I have completed while exploring Temporal!

### 📩 [Email Subscription Project-based Tutorial](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/email-subscription-project-java)
* This project is a simulation of an email subscription service that I translated into Java from one of Temporal's project-based tutorials in Python. Temporal's education team was able to use my work in this project build out their Java tutorials!

### 🚕 [Cab Service Saga](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/temporal-saga-pattern)
* This project is an example of a saga pattern for a distributed system that simulates booking a cab through a ride service. Originally, this saga was implemented in Orkes Conductor framework (another durable execution platform), I translated the Conductor code into the Temporal framework and reworked the back-end.

### 💬 [AI Chatbot](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/temporal-openai-java)
* This project is a Java web application that uses OpenAI's API to respond to user-entered questions. I translated this project from Python when I began learning to use Temporal.

### 🎛️ Python Backend for [Food Delivery](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/food-delivery/tree/python_backend) and [Order Management](https://github.com/SeanSullivan3/temporal-order-management/tree/python_backend) Services
* Built a Temporal backend in Python for these two example services.
